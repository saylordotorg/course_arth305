This course serves as an introduction to the major pre-Modern artistic
traditions of India, China, and Japan.  It is organized into three units
that focus on the art and architecture of India, China, and Japan
respectively.  Each unit is structured chronologically.  Unit 1 examines
Indian Art from the Indus Valley Civilization (c. 2600-1900 BCE) through
the art of the Mughal Empire (1526-1858), focusing on Buddhist, Hindu,
and Islamic art and architecture.  Unit 2 covers the arts of China from
the Shang Dynasty (c.1600-1050 BCE) through the Qing Dynasty
(1644-1911), detailing the interaction between art, politics, and
culture throughout Chinese dynastic history.  Unit 3 introduces Japanese
Art from the Jomon Period (c.10,500-300 BCE) through the Edo Period
(1615-1868), exploring the effects that various sub-traditions and
sub-cultures (Tang Dynasty China, Buddhism, and the warrior class) had
on the art of Japan. After completing this course, you will have a
comprehensive understanding of the arts and architecture of pre-Modern
India, China, and Japan and their relationship to the history and
culture of their respective times and places.
