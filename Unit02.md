**Unit 2: The Art and Architecture of China** <span id="2"></span> 
*This unit introduces the art and architecture of China from the Shang
(c.1600-1050 BCE) through the Qing (1644-1911) dynasties.  Examining art
from first millennium BCE through second century CE tombs, it begins by
looking at the “Great Bronze Age of China” and the role that art played
in the founding of the first Chinese Empires.  We will then focus on the
introduction of Buddhism to China and its role in Chinese art through
the Tang Dynasty (618-907).  The unit concludes by exploring the
development of three artistic traditions—calligraphy, painting, and
porcelain—in the Song (960-1279) through Qing Dynasties.  After
completing this unit, you will have a comprehensive understanding of the
major artistic traditions of China and their relationship to
contemporary political, social, and religious developments.*
