**Unit 3: The Art and Architecture of Japan** <span id="3"></span> 
*This unit serves as an introduction to the art and architecture of
Japan from the Jomon (c.10,500-300BCE) through Edo (1615-1868) Periods. 
After looking at the art of prehistoric and proto-historic Japan, this
unit examines seventh through twelfth century Japanese art and its
adoption and adaptation of Buddhist and royal artistic traditions from
Korea and China.  This unit then focuses on Japanese art from the
thirteenth through nineteenth centuries, when Japan was controlled by
the warrior class, which was comprised of active patrons of the arts and
Buddhism.   After completing this unit, you will have a comprehensive
understanding of the major artistic traditions of Japan and their
relationship to contemporary political, social, and religious
developments.*
